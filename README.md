Social Network: Tokenization JSON object and outputting to HTML

Created by Sean Kozina Septemeber of 2022
First project of my "Data Strutures course"

Consists of 3 classes and a main file that are linked together to parse through tokenization of json objects 
to be manipulated to create a social network and be outputed in html


The .json files are the input files to be read into the program. The program will then run the .cpp files 
and output .html files with all the necassary information
